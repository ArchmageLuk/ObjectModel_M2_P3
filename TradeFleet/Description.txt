Solution for construction of spaceship based on imputs

1. Program.cs launches method Main()
2. Main() launches StartConstruction() in ConstructionYard().cs
3. ConstructionYard() promts user to choose size of ship hull
4. After choosing size of the hull, it creates corresponding array of ShipParts.cs (3 for small, 5 for medium, 7 for big)
5. Then user chooses tipe of Bridge for the first module, set of middle modules (cargo, weapon, living quarters, engines) and the engine for the last
6. All choosen modules are written into the created array.
7. Then Shipyard calculates cost, weight, speed, military power and number of personnel by going throug corresponding fields of every object in the array
8. Then program gives little summary of created ship (i.e. "small, fast and dangerous — perfect patrol boat", or "big hull, big cargo — use it to carry goods" etc.)



To achieve:
1. Count the price of constructed ship (sum of modules)
2. Sort modules of the result ship by their price
3. Make search engine for the needed module (by its parameters)
